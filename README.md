## This is my Capstone Project from my INSAID Program of *Global Certification of Data Science and Artifical Intelligence* 

**The client for this project is the Administration Department at AutoBox having over a thousand employees.**

The model is able to **recognize the person present in the images**, and if the model hasnâ€™t seen a person before, it shows **output a message suggesting that this person is not found in the database and entry is restricted,** and also labelled it as Unidentified in the submission file.

# **Conclusion**

-   We studied  **in-depth**  about the various  **features**  from the images.
    
-   We build different models and  **compared**  their performance.
    
-   By using  **transfer learning**  we  **reduced the time**  of  **training**  the model and improved the accuracy of the model.
    
-   We created our final model using  **Facenet**  and made predictions on the test set using it.
